<a href="https://www.tmleuven.be/en/" target="_blank">Transport & Mobility</a>
Leuven (TML), a traffic engineering consultancy, and <a href="https://www.mobiel21.be/" target="_blank">Mobiel21</a>, an NGO focussing on citizen participation in the field of mobility.<p>

<p>Seeing how citizens science projects have been succesful to collect valuable data in collaboration with citizens in other fields like
air quality data, we thought: we should be able to do the same with traffic counting data! And so, in 2019 we embarked on our journey to
first develop <a href="https://telraam.net/en/v1">a simple sensor</a> and later in
2023 <a href="https://telraam.net/en/S2">a purpose built sensor</a> for collecting traffic counting data, together with citizens.</p>',

educates citizens to become the future technicians and traffic engineers of their communities, who can bring local knowledge to the table,
and become a driving force in conversations and debates on urban mobility policies that affect their neighborhoods. </p>

<p>We want to provide affordable solutions to connect citizens and their local governments, and facilitate the shift towards a more
human-focused, multimodal traffic culture. </p>',

'section2-block2-text'        => '<p>Coming from a traffic engineering background, we know traffic counting data. We breathe traffic counting data. We understand what type of data can be valuable for professionals. Are you a mobility professional; a non-profit organization, a traffic engineering or consultancy firm, a transport agency, or a local government?<br>
 <br>
 Are you looking for affordable, multimodal traffic monitoring solutions for your projects that can be deployed on a
  large number of locations? Then Telraam is the right place for you!</p>',
