is blocked by that damn tree? Obviously, you don\'t want to cut down the tree, but you do want to count traffic, so for you,
it\'d be best to have a Telraam actually outside, maybe attached to the tree.</p>

<p>You\'re not the only one and we\'ve heard your call. To address this need, we have embarked on a new development journey to
develop an autonomous Telraam S2 device which you can install outdoors. We want to keep the simplicity of installation, so
 don\'t mess with power cables or wifi connections, so our approach is to fit our existing S2 device in a safe enclosure
 and combine it with a small solar panel and internal battery. Because our device consumes very little power, we expect to get
 by with a small solar panel & battery.</p>',

	to detect traffic, so the same requirements in terms location apply',

 	'answer-2' 			=> 'We don\'t know yet. Obviously adding a solar panel, battery, enclosure and mounting mechanism,
 	and more complex assembly will add to the cost. Expect an additional cost of several 100â‚¬s',

 	'question-3'           => ' Is the device fully power independent?',
 	'answer-3' 			=> 'Almost. You can get 100% full autonomy with a large solar panel + battery, but there\'s a sensible trade-off
 	between size of battery and solar panel and the cost. We\'re trying to find the right balance during the prototype phase.'
