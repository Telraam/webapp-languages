    <strong>Typical traffic data</strong><br>

    Typical traffic is the foundation of many of the analytical tools and data products that we offer to our subscribers.
    As an example, typicala data includes the typical (average) counts (and the most likely range) for the expected car traffic for a Monday morning
    between 08:00 and 08:15 based on the last 12 months\' actual traffic - but you can choose a different mode, day of week, time of day, and baseline
    period as you wish. How does this work in practice?
    <ul class="jump-in">
        <li>We provide typical traffic volumes calculated as the average (and standard deviation) of historical traffic counts over
        the periods of a year, a season, and a month leading up to the date of the calculation (referred to as the epoch).</li>
        <li>Each typical product is calculated at regular intervals to provide a continuously growing set of historical
        averages corresponding to various epochs. The data is made available on a quarterly and hourly resolution,
        for each mode, down to each day of the week (including a more general weekday and weekend option too).</li>

    is unexpected compared to the average of the past month, season, or year, depending on the used typical data product. Is the anomaly short lived or long-term,

    long-term changes into the spotlight. The 3D histogram is a very powerful visualisation tool, but if you just want to compare the traffic levels of a
    few selected epochs to eachoter, you can use our traditional interactive 2D plot for that. With the number of modes, weekdays, typical intervals, and calculation
