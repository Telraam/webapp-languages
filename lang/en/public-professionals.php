thus register cars, heavy traffic as well as cyclists and pedestrians, are the base of any traffic engineering study. Classic traffic counts
 are limited today: both in time and in counting modes. In addition, they are often expensive and not very transparent.<br>
 <br>
New technologies provide innovative measurement methods. Telraam has developed high-tech and reliable measuring equipment that measures
 and analyse traffic in a finely-meshed, continuous, multimodal way and in conjunction with citizens.
 Telraam provides the right research question and the appropriate research technology, and the citizens count and think along with it. <br>
 <br>
For this purpose, we developed a Telraam trajectory that we offer to local governments. The local government chooses a programme of, for example, 8 months, citizens can apply and start counting after screening and selection.
Data analysis and support is provided during the process. Telraam takes care of everything and provides support from start to finish.<br>',

    discover how much and what kind of traffic passes along through their street and so have a direct personal
    involvement in local mobility policy. In this way, highly relevant traffic data is collected in a participatory
     manner that can underpin local policy decisions. <br>
<br>
Citizens are guided throughout the entire Telraam project. They learn how to set-up their own fully automatic traffic counter
 and how to interpret the data and even to communicate about it. They can then collaborate with others, neighbours, local
 campaign groups, citizen movements and other counters across the world.<br>
<br>
This way, participating citizens become citizen scientists that make constructive, objective and data-driven contributions to
local mobility policy that is also engaging and relevant.',

    <li>The professional Telraam network dashboard allows local authorities to monitor the Telraam-devices in their project area,

    <li>Through the Telraam API, anyone can retrieve all traffic data directly, under an open data licence, for application
    in their own database or existing dashboard. Telraam has already won the award for API of the Year in 2020.</li>
