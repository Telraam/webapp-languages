    'section1-block1-text' => 'Traffic counts are essential for a sound mobility policy. Counts that are multimodal, and register cars and heavy vehicles as well as cyclists and pedestrians, are the base of any traffic engineering study. Classic traffic counts are limited today: both in time and in counting modes. In addition, they are often expensive and not very transparent.<br><br>
    New technology can provide innovative measurement methods without costing a fortune. Telraam has developed high-tech and reliable measuring equipment that quantifies and categorises traffic in a finely-meshed, continuous, multimodal way and in conjunction with citizens.
 Telraam provides the research effort and the appropriate technology and data services, and the citizens count and provide local insight to support it. <br>
 <br>
We have developed a Telraam solution for local governments and authorities as well as campaign groups. The organisation chooses a programme running for several months (usually 6-12+), then engages citizens to apply, and after screening and selection can start counting.
Data analysis and support is provided by the Telraam team throughout the process, from start to finish.<br>',

    'section2-block1-title' => 'Citizens',
    'section2-block1-text' => 'Telraam provides a means to actively engage with citizens to deliver traffic counts. Residents are already motivated to discover how much and what kind of traffic passes along through their street and so have a direct personal involvement in local mobility policy. In this way, highly relevant traffic data is collected in a participatory manner that can underpin local policy decisions. <br>
<br>
    Citizens who apply and are selected, are guided throughout the entire Telraam project. They learn how to set-up their own fully automatic traffic counter and how to interpret the data and even to communicate about it. They can then collaborate with others, neighbours, local campaign groups, citizen movements and other counters across the world.<br>
<br>
    In this way, participating citizens become citizen scientists that make constructive, objective and data-driven contributions to local mobility policy that is also engaging and relevant.',

    'section2-block2-text' => 'The count data collected are a valuable basis for  traffic and mobility planning and decision-making in a city or municipality. <br>
    <br>Telraam data can also be used to measure the concrete impact of a planned mobility measure or intervention, supporting and validating policy measures.<br><br>
    The data can also be used by researchers, residents and interested parties to support a position or choice, helping to make local discussions more constructive.',

    'section2-block3-text' => 'After several months of counting, participants are invited to come together again for a Telraam data workshop.<br><br>
    The traffic data collected by the Telraam devices in the network are explained. In these interactive workshops we conduct collaborative analysis and interpretation, drawing conclusions and formulating proposals in partnership with citizens. In consultation with the network manager and client, certain subjects or solutions can be included or specific measures and traffic situations can be explored.<br>
    <br>
    The data workshops focus on capturing the unique knowledge and local context of the citizens who participate. After all, who knows what insights can be gathered from involving those who actually live there?',

<ul class="text-list">
    <li>The traffic data collected is made available to the public via the interactive map on the Telraam homepage.</li>
    <li>The professional Telraam network dashboard allows local authorities to monitor the Telraam devices in their project area, export the data and perform live analysis.</li>
    <li>Through the Telraam API, anyone can retrieve all traffic data directly, under an open data, non-commercial licence, for use in their own database or existing dashboard. Telraam won the award for "API of the Year" in 2020.</li>
