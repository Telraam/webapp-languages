    However to make sure the device counts accurately we would like to ask you to select the best region of interest (ROI) for your camera.<br><br>
    
    The S2 has a built-in, wide-angle camera and the image recognition works best if you can narrow down the view of the camera.  We don't want the device to count birds or flying trash cans but use all its resources for tracking the activity in your street.<br>
