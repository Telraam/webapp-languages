<p>Todayâ€™s dominance of motorised vehicles as the primary means of transport in our cities and towns means that their traffic levels negatively
impact, or simly directly cause many health and social issues, which urgently need to be addressed. </p>

<p>Traffic counting in itself is not a solution, but it can be a powerful, quantitative tool in capable hands, forming a solid basis for meaningful reforms.</p>',

In this setup the Telraam sensors are hosted by citizen scientists, establishing a valuable bridge between their neighbourhoods, local authorities, and mobility professionals. This connection, and the open access to the collected traffic data, democratises local traffic planning, and opens up new opportunities for all involved parties.</p>',

    <p>Citizen science projects can be a cost-effective way for local authorities to gather data and gain insights

    'cit-science-item-2' => '<strong  class="green">Local knowledge</strong><br>
    <p>Citizen scientists are residents of the community in which they are collecting data, which means they have the 
     local knowledge and perspectives that can be valuable in understanding local issues and developing locally applicable solutions.</p>',

    'cit-science-item-3' => '<strong  class="green">Engaging the community</strong><br>
    <p>Citizen science projects can be a way to engage members of the community in the decision-making process and
     to get them more invested in finding solutions to the local challenges.</p>',

    'cit-science-item-4' => '<strong  class="green">Broader impact</strong><br>
    <p>By involving citizens in the data-gathering process, local authorities can also create a greater sense of ownership and buy-in for solutions
     that are developed as a result of these collaborations, which will lead to more widespread adoption and a greater positive impact and reception in the community.</p>',

      <strong>Access to new technologies</strong><br>
    <p>Citizen science projects can also provide an opportunity for local authorities to tap into new technologies
    and techniques that can be used to gather and analyse data, such as smartphone apps or crowdsourced mapping platforms.</p> */
