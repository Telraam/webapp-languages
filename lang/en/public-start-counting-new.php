impact, or are a root-cause of, many health and social issues that urgently need to be addressed. </p>

    'cit-science-item-4' => '<strong  class="green">Broader impact</strong><br>
    <p>By involving citizens in the data-gathering process, local authorities can also create a greater sense of ownership and buy-in for any solutions
