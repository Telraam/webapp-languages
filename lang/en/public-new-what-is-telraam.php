A Telraam device continuously monitors a street from a citizen’s window, providing crucial data on vehicles,
pedestrians, bikes and more. These devices also create the opportunity for dialogue between traffic planners
& city authorities and their most affected communities - the citizens who live on, and use, these streets.<br>

The S2 uses AI and Machine Learning to provide continuous, reliable, standardised Open data. Citizen scientists place a
 Telraam device in their window, and the collected data can be shared with local authorities and policy makers.<br>
<br>
This can be done by citizens on their individual streets, or by local campaign groups or government authorities who fund
 citizen networks in order to gather this data.<br>
