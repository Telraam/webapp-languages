<br>
Our Telraam sensor continuously monitors a street from a citizen’s window, providing crucial data on various modes of transport, including motorised vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, and more. Telraam networks also create the opportunity for dialogue between traffic planners, local authorities and their most affected communities: the citizens who live on - and use - these streets, by turning traffic counting into an open and accessible citizen science project.<br><br>',

<br>
Telraam S2 uses specially-trained AI and a proprietary tracking algorithm to detect, classify, and count road users with high precision in a wide range of typical street environments. Citizens place a Telraam sensor in their window, and the open data that is colleected can be shared with local authorities and policy makers.<br>
<br>
Telraam devices can be set up by citizens on their individual streets, or by local campaign groups and government authorities who fund citizen networks in order to gather local traffic data.<br>

Once connected, you don’t need to do anything, just watch the counts as they happen.<br>
<br>
The Telraam S2 has a low resolution camera (for privacy), an AI chip for detecting and categorising street users, and a built in mobile data connection that relays aggregated, anonymous data to the Telraam servers. The device simply needs to be powered and mounted on the inside of an upper-floor window with an unobstructed view over the street.',
