    <p>The overall goal of Clean Air campaigns <span class="tiny">[<a href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/air"  target="_blank">&#128279;</a>]</span> are to ensure that we all,
    but especially children, get a chance to breathe air that is not unhealthy or unsafe from pollutants
    <span class="tiny">[<a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/air-pollution/causes" target="_blank">&#128279;</a>]</span> including Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Carbon monoxide (CO),
    Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and Particular matters (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1).</p>

<p>It has been estimated that such air pollution from fossil fuels is responsible for between 1 in every 9, and up to 1 in 5

 deaths in the world. The burning of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines (ICE) is a major contributor to this,
  especially in the concentrated environment of cities in proximity to our living spaces. Cars are not the only culprit,
  but they are the one we can most easily influence, and will have the most direct impact on individuals’ health.</p>

<p>The three most important interventions to achieve these goals are:
<ul class="jump-in">
<li>Switch vehicles away from fossil fuels, for example to electric vehicles (EV)</li>
<li>Reduce total number of vehicle miles driven, switching to active travel modes</li>
<li>Increase mitigation measures, such as planting more trees or pollution-abating plants.</li>
</ul></p> ',

    'section-2-title' => 'What do we need to measure?',
    'section-2-text' => '<p>Of course, it is important to measure air quality data to understand the issues we face, and where they are at
their worst. However, while maps of air quality might highlight the link between poor air quality and roads and high traffic levels,
 on their own they will not distinguish between which interventions are having an impact.</p>

<p>If the measure is to reduce car journeys, then you also need to know how many cars are actually using the road, and when.
 Then you need to see which actions to reduce this are effective, such as legal speed restrictions, traffic calming, modal filters,
 behavioural messaging, road pricing, etc. Finally, you can match these interventions to the quality of the air that results.</p>

<p>It is therefore important to track any interventions that are designed to change traffic volume not just the location of the intervention,
 but the surrounding streets as well. Like air movements, it is important to ensure traffic is not just reduced at a particular location through displacement.</p>

<p>Targeting volumes and speeds of vehicles is obviously of primary importance, but it is also essential to measure whether this is just a reduction in the
 number of car journeys on a road, or whether there is an active switch to alternative active travel modes, such as walking or cycling. </p>

<p>In order to ensure that interventions and outcomes can be accurately attributed, and further enhancements (or corrections) can be carried out, it is
important to have traffic counts before, during and after. Continuous measurement allows for more accurate solutions that are improved through feedback
loops and local experience.</p>',

    'section-3-title' => 'Putting plans into action',
    'section-3-text' => '<p>In order to get that feedback and local support, it is critically important to involve
     the local community in the planning, tracking and development of solutions. The local community are those who are most
     exposed to the poor quality air and toxic elements, and will be those who can benefit most directly from changes, and will
     be motivated to take part in actions that they believe are positive and they can trust.</p>

<p>Involving local residents in data gathering, also known as Citizen Science, is key to Telraam’s process, not just because it
 gives access to be able to gather the data, but because it leads to more positive experiences and outcomes overall.</p>

<p>In practice, it is those who are most directly affected who also have the most direct views of the streets and traffic causing the
air quality issues. They will be not only motivated to support the research, but will be less likely to resist any intervention because
 they will know what data has been gathered, when and how, and are more likely to feel ownership of the results.</p>

<p>If you are interested in air quality interventions in your street, neighbourhood, town or city, then you should also make sure
you also have the traffic data to support your plans and conclusions. </p>',
