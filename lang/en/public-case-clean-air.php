    'section-1-title' => 'Telraam x Clean air measures',
    'section-1-text' => ' <p>Clean air is one of the main challenges faced by our urban areas in the 21st century. The level of premature death caused by air
 pollution on a global scale means policy action on this matter is urgent
  <a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/air-pollution/causes"><span class="heroicon heroicon-external-link"></span></a></p>

<p>Car traffic, still dominated by combustion engines, remains one of the main contributors to air pollution and so is a key part of the
solution to achieving clean air, and monitoring traffic is therefore an important element in any policy action on clean air initiatives.</p>

<p>Deploying Telraam devices fulfils several essential roles in air quality monitoring activities:
<ol>
    <li>Telraam, as a device for monitoring local traffic volumes, complements direct air quality measurements.</li>
    <li>Actions tackling air pollution often aim for a reduction of vehicle traffic, so Telraam delivers a detailed long-term tracking of air quality mitigation actions,
    before and after implementation.
    </li>
    <li>By engaging citizens directly in monitoring activities using Telraam raises public awareness and creates ownership of solutions. </li>
</ol>
</p>',


    'section-2-title' => 'Measuring air quality',
    'section-2-text-col-1' => '<h4>Understand the issues</h4><p>It is important to measure air quality data to understand the issues we face, and where they are at their worst.
However, while maps of air quality might highlight the link between poor air quality and roads and high traffic levels, on their own they do not
distinguish between which interventions are having an impact. Also, air quality monitoring equipment is quite expensive, so air quality data is
unavailable in most locations. </p>

<p>If the objective is to reduce car journeys, then you need to know how many cars are actually using the road, and when. You also need to assess
which actions to reduce this are effective, such as legal speed restrictions, traffic calming, modal filters, behavioural messaging, road pricing,
 etc. Finally, you can match these interventions to the quality of the air that results. </p>',

'section-2-text-col-2' => '<h4>Track interventions</h4><p>It is therefore important to track interventions designed to change traffic volume, not just the location of the intervention, but the
surrounding streets as well. Like air movements, it is important to ensure traffic is not just reduced at a particular location through displacement.</p>

<p>It is important to have traffic counts before, during and after, in order to ensure that interventions and outcomes can be accurately attributed, and
further enhancements (or corrections) can be carried out. Continuous measurement allows for more accurate solutions that are improved through feedback
loops and local experience.</p>',
    

    'section-3-title' => 'Putting plans into action',
    'section-3-text' => '<p>In order to get feedback and local support, it is critically important to involve the local community in the planning,
tracking and development of solutions. The local community are those who are most exposed to the poor quality air and toxic elements, and
will be those who can benefit most directly from changes, and will be motivated to take part in actions that they believe are positive
and they can trust.</p>

<h4>Citizen Science</h4>
<p>Involving local residents in data gathering, also known as Citizen Science, is key to Telraam’s process, not just because it gives access to be
able to gather the data, but because it leads to more positive experiences and outcomes overall.</p>

<p>In practice, it is those who are most directly affected who also have the most direct views of the streets and traffic causing the air
quality issues. They will be not only motivated to support the research, but will be less likely to resist any intervention because they
will know what data has been gathered, when and how, and are more likely to feel ownership of the results.</p>

<p>If you are interested in air quality interventions in your street, neighbourhood, town or city, then you should also make sure you
also have the traffic data to support your plans and conclusions. </p>',

    'section-4-title' => 'Clean air campaigns',
    'section-4-text' => '<p>The overall goal of Clean Air campaigns [<a href="https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/air"><span class="heroicon heroicon-external-link"></span></a>] are
 to ensure that we all, but especially children, get a chance to breathe air that is not unhealthy or unsafe from
  pollutants [<a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/air-pollution/causes"><span class="heroicon heroicon-external-link"></span></a>]
 including Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and Particular matters (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1).

<h4>Impact</h4>
<p>It has been estimated that such air pollution from fossil fuels is responsible for between 1 in every 9, and up to 1 in 5
 [<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/news/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-responsible-for-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide/"><span class="heroicon heroicon-external-link"></span></a>], deaths in the world.
  The burning of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines (ICE) is a major contributor to this, especially in the concentrated environment
  of cities in proximity to our living spaces. Cars are not the only culprit, but they are the one we can most easily influence, and will
  have the most direct impact on individuals’ health.</p>

  <p>
  The three most important interventions to achieve these goals are:
  <li>Switch vehicles away from fossil fuels, for example to electric vehicles (EV)</li>
  <li>Reduce total number of vehicle miles driven, switching to active travel modes</li>
  <li>Increase mitigation measures, such as planting more trees or pollution-abating plants</li>
