                The basic information from Telraam devices is standardised and open so that devices anywhere in the world
                can be used for local engagement by their hosts, their communities and their local
                authorities.<br>
                <br>
                Navigate to any device on the Telraam map, and you will be able to see data
                for that street.<br>
                <br>
                This same information is available to the device owner, who will also receive a monthly report via email, and will have the ability to export their data in a spreadsheet so they can do some further analysis.
                Additional data, insights, reports and exports are available via our <a href="/en/data-subscription">paying premium subscription</a>.',

                When you purchase the device with a premium subscription, we are including a subscription to full package that takes full advantage of the capabilities of the Telraam S2 device, and covers the cost of data communications, additional dashboards and reports.
                A personal device comes with at a minimum with the standard data and reports mentioned above but you are not paying for the data communications.',


    'section-3-title' => 'Who is the free option intended for?',
    'section-3-text' => ' While Telraam sets up networks of devices, both large and small, to gather
                useful traffic data for neighbourhoods or even cities, there is an important
                role for individual explorers and citizen scientists who can then raise
                local issues.<br>
                <br>
                For this reason, Telraam uses revenue from our professional & data contracts
                to cover the costs of managing your device - for life! As a private citizen,
                you can still buy a single device and gather the data for as long as you like
                to use for your own projects.<br><br>
                Because of this subsidy and support, this is strictly for individual, private citizens. If you are
                an organisation involved in campaigning on, consulting for, or managing local transport and mobility
                 projects, then please check out our <a href="/en/network">‘Network’ package</a>.'
