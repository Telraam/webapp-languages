     'body' => 'Thank you for purchasing a Telraam S2 from our web store. We are very grateful that you
     have decided to join our growing network of traffic counters all over the world. <br>
<br>
We know that you will want to start counting as soon as possible, so here is a short timeline for the
shipping of your Telraam package. <br>
<br>

We currently ship all online orders ourselves at the end of every working week from our HQ in Leuven, Belgium.
Depending on the country you ordered from, it can take your Telraam package anything from a few days
(for EU-countries) to two weeks (outside EU) to reach the country of destination.<br>
<br>
Once your Telraam leaves our office we include your details in the track and trace system of our local carrier
 BPost. You should then receive updates on your order’s progress via email (please check your spam-folder). <br>
<br>
For countries outside the EU :<br>
<ul>
<li>Local duty procedures may apply before your Telraam can be handed over to a local carrier who will
deliver the package to you. It might be possible you’ll have to pay additional custom duties.</li>
<li>Also you may have to purchase an additional USB-C plug as the devices currently ship with a EU adapter
only. An extra long 3m cable is included in the package.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
If you haven’t heard news or received your Telraam device after a couple of weeks, do feel
 free to get in <a href=mailto:support@telraam.net>touch with Telraam</a>.<br>
<br><br>
Happy counting<br>
Team Telraam'];
