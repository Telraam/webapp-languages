These measurements need to record cars, heavy vehicles, but also public transport, cyclists and pedestrians. Counting is currently expensive, limited in time, and rarely records all forms of transport.  <br>
New technology allows for innovative ways of measuring in a continuous, multimodal, dense and efficient way. Citizen science air quality metering projects such as Luftdaten have paved the way.',

Telraam handles the research and the technology. Citizens supply access, data and local knowledge. Participants get insights into traffic on their street, and at the same time provide the public authorities with good traffic counts; data that can be used to make infrastructure, traffic lights and traffic management plans more efficient and more effective.',
