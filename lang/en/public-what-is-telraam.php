Telraam S2 uses specially-trained AI and a proprietary tracking algorithm to detect, classify, and count road users with high precision in a wide range of typical street environments. Citizens place a Telraam sensor in their window, and the data that is collected can be shared with local authorities and policy makers as Open Data.<br>
<br>
Telraam devices can be set up by citizens on their individual streets, or by local campaign groups and government authorities who fund citizen networks to gather local traffic data.<br>

    <p>Traffic counting in itself is not the solution, but it can be a powerful, quantitative tool in capable hands, forming a solid basis for meaningful discussions and reforms.</p>

    <p>Forward-thinking local authorities are finding ways to address these social issues, to make our communities cleaner, safer, and healthier, but to do this they need supporting data.</p>

    <p>By involving citizens in the data-gathering process, local authorities can also create a greater sense of ownership and buy-in for solutions
