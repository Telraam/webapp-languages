Measurements which record cars, heavy vehicles, public transport, cyclists and pedestrians are necessary. Counting is currently expensive, limited in time, and rarely records all forms of transport.  <br>
New technology offers possibilities for innovative ways of measuring in a continuous, multimodal, dense and efficient way. Citizen science air quality metering projects such as Luftdaten have paved the way..',

Telraam handles the research work and the technology. Citizens supply the data.  Participants find out about traffic in their street, and at the same time help the public authorities with good traffic counts. The data can be used to make infrastructure, traffic lights and traffic management plans more efficient and more effective.',

All the collected counts are made available for policymaking and research, but also to all residents and interested parties.',
