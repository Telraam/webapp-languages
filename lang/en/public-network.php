    <br>Thanks to AI-driven technology and the unique deployment-model of <a href="https://www.telraam.net/en/S2">Telraam devices</a>, we provide an alternative, cost-efficient counting method that has been proven both <a href="https://github.com/Telraam/Telraam-S2/blob/main/count-performance-validation.md">accurate and precise</a> in a wide variety of conditions.<br>
    <br>By deploying a number of Telraam devices in an area, the counting process can be much improved, gathering multi-modal data on a continuous basis by creating a finely meshed network of devices powered by citizen science, increasing the data gathered and reducing the cost.<br>
    <br>Telraam offer the Network solution for organisations running multiple devices, such as local governments and authorities as well as campaign groups.',

    <br>Telraam data can also be used to measure the impact of a planned mobility measure or intervention, supporting and validating policy measures whether it is a local or even a national infrastructure project.<br>
    <br>The data can also be used by researchers, residents and interested parties to validate their campaigns for changes, helping to make local discussions more effective and constructive.<br>
    <br>With this tool, any organisation can choose a programme to run for several months (usually 6-12 months or more), engage citizens to apply, and use the dashboard to screen and select locations so users can start counting. Data analysis and support is provided by the Telraam team throughout the process, from start to finish.',

In this way motivated residents have a more direct, personal involvement in local mobility policy.<br>
    <br>Network subscription tools streamline the recruitment, application, and selection process of citizens.. They learn how to set-up their own fully automatic traffic counter and how to better understand the data.
