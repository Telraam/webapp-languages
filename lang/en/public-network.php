    <br>Thanks to AI-driven technology and the unique deployment-model of <a href="https://www.telraam.net/en/S2">Telraam devices</a>, we provide an alternative, cost-efficient, multi-modal counting method that has been proven both <a href="https://github.com/Telraam/Telraam-S2/blob/main/count-performance-validation.md">accurate and precise</a> in a wide variety of conditions.<br>
    <br>Telraam offers a Network subscription for organisations running multiple devices, such as governments and authorities from local to national level as well as activist groups. By deploying a finely meshed network of Telraam devices powered by citizen science, the traffic counting process can be much improved, gathering multi-modal data on a continuous basis, while reducing the costs.',

    <br>Real-time and historical data can be assessed and analysed any time, or it can be exported for off-line analysis. Support is provided by the Telraam team throughout the process, from start to finish.',

This way motivated residents have a more direct, personal involvement in local mobility policy.<br>
    <br>Network subscription tools streamline the recruitment, application, and selection process of citizens. They learn how to set-up their own fully automated traffic counter and how to better understand the data. Participants become citizen scientists that can make constructive, objective, data-driven contributions to the local policy-making process.<br>
    <br>Telraam data can also be used by researchers, residents, and interested parties to, e.g., validate their requests for changes in the local circulation plans, making objective, data-driven contributions to the discussions.',

 with citizens.<br><br>
We share our data in a few different ways:
 <ul class="text-list">
    <li>Basic traffic data is accessible through an interactive map on our website.</li>
    <li>Most count data is freely available as open data, with a non-commercial licence.</li>

    devices in their project area, export data, and conduct live analyses.</li>
    <li>We offer a data pool module for professionals, providing reporting, analytics, and access to the advanced API for specific locations outside of their own fleet.
     This also opens up the API for broader use. Learn more on our <a href="/en/data-pool">data pool</a> page.</li>
