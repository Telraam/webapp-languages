<br>By deploying a number of Telraam devices in an area, this process can be much improved, gathering multi-modal data on a continuous basis by creating a finely meshed network of devices powered by citizen science, increasing the data gathered and reducing the cost.<br>
<br>Telraam   offer the Network solution for organisations running multiple devices, such as local governments and authorities as well as campaign groups. <br>
<br>With this tool, the organisation can choose a programme to run for several months (usually 6-12 months or more), engage citizens to apply, and use the dashboard to  screen and select locations so users can start counting. Data analysis and support is provided by the Telraam team throughout the process, from start to finish.',

In this way, highly relevant traffic data is collected in a participatory manner that can underpin local policy decisions.<br>
    <br>Citizens who apply and are selected, are guided throughout the entire Telraam project. They learn how to set-up their own fully automatic traffic counter and how to interpret the data and even to communicate about it. They can then collaborate with others, neighbours, local campaign groups, citizen movements and other counters across the world.<br>
    <br>In this way, participating citizens become citizen scientists that make constructive, objective and data-driven contributions to local mobility policy that is also engaging and relevant.',
