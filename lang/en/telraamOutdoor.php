no suitable windows nearby to host a Telraam S2 with a citizen? It can happen: there are trees in the way, the street
is in an industrial area or in a national park far from residential buildings, or simply you want to monitor a cycle
path beyond the city limits. For these cases, installing a Telraam S2 Outdoor is the solution. You can mount it on a
light pole or a tree, attach a power source (e.g., a small solar panel and a battery), and count in new places!</p>',

    'section1-block2-text'        => '<p>We\'ve heard from many users that there are circumstances that require some
devices in a network to be placed in outside locations. Whether this is for cycle paths in open spaces, to raise the
device into the eaves of a single-storey building, on a balcony that otherwise obscures the window view, or maybe on
the outside of a building to avoid overhangs and other structures in the way. To address this need, we have been on a
journey to develop a version of the Telraam S2 device which you can install outdoors and even be powered autonomously.<br>
<br>
 We wanted to keep the installation (both on <a href="https://telraam.net/">telraam.net</a> and outdoors) as
  simple as possible, so our approach has been to put our existing S2 device in a fully weatherproof enclosure.
  This can be plugged into residential power when available, or - thanks to the very low power consumption -
  it is possible to operate the device continuously using power from the combination of a small solar panel
  and a battery pack (sold separately).</p>',

The Telraam Outdoor unit is DC powered. A built-in DC convertor only requires 12-24V power input.',

Placing the device outdoor allows a wider range of counting locations in addition to residential streets.',

Technical expertise is only required to supply the outdoor device with power, but a manual and support materials are included.

 Functionally, it works just like the indoor Telraam S2 and runs the same software to detect traffic.<br>

    'question-2'           => ' Is the device fully power independent?',
    'answer-2' 			=> 'Almost. You can get 100% full autonomy with a large solar panel + battery, but there\'s a sensible trade-off
 	between size of battery and solar panel and the cost. We believe we found the right balance during the prototype phase.',
