is blocked by a tree? Or maybe you want to monitor a path with no windows nearby? Obviously, you don\'t want to cut down trees, but you still want to count traffic, so it would be ideal to have a Telraam actually outside, ... maybe even attached to the tree.</p>

<p>We\'ve heard from many users that there are circumstances that require some devices in a network to be placed in outside locations. Whether this is for cycle paths in open spaces, to raise the device into the eaves of a single-storey building, on a balcony that otherwise obscures the window view, or maybe on the outside of a building to avoid overhangs and other structures in the way. To address this need, we have been on a journey to develop a version of the Telraam S2 device which you can install outdoors and even be powered autonomously. We still wanted to keep the simplicity of installation, so our approach has been to put our existing S2 device in a weather-safe enclosure which can be plugged in to residential power if available, but also, because it consumes very little power, make it possible to combine it with a small solar panel and internal battery.</p>',

 The device functions just like the regular S2 for indoor use and runs the same software to detect traffic. This means it has the same <a href="https://faq.telraam.net/article/3/requirements-for-the-installation-of-a-telraam-in-my-window">location requirements</a> as the indoor Telraam S2.',
