concern. New technological evolutions (IoT, low-cost sensors, edge computing)
strengthen the possibilities of citizen science and enable citizens to actively contribute to
the collection and interpretation of data themselves. In this way, citizens can help
develop solutions to local mobility problems.</p>
<p>At Telraam, we are empowering citizens to collect traffic data and we are bringing
citizens and local governments together. We support the development of local networks
of our sensors for the automatic counting of traffic data by citizens in cooperation with
local authorities.</p>',
